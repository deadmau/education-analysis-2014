dyspeptic ."positive,"a smart , witty follow-up ."positive,"while the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they're presented with a wry dark humor ."positive,an infectious cultural

laughs ."positive,it provides an honest look at a community striving to anchor itself in new grounds .positive,"add yet another hat to a talented head , clooney's a good director ."positive,"building slowly and subtly , the film , sporting a breezy spontaneity and realistically drawn characterizations , develops into a significant character study that is both moving and wise

startling optimism , of the children ."positive,a rigorously structured and exquisitely filmed drama about a father and son connection that is a brief shooting star of love .positive,this surreal gilliam-esque film is also a troubling interpretation of ecclesiastes . a rewarding work of art for only the most patient and challenge-hungry moviegoers .positive,a quiet treasure -- a film to be savored .positive,"may be far from the best of the series , but it's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation ."positive,a compelling spanish film about the withering effects of jealousy in the life of a young monarch whose sexual passion for her husband becomes an obsession .positive,huston nails both the glad-handing and the choking sense of hollow despair .positive,"may not have generated many sparks , but with his affection for astoria and its people he has given his tale a warm glow ."positive,a delirious celebration of the female orgasm .positive,"exquisitely nuanced in mood tics and dialogue , this chamber drama is superbly acted by the deeply appealing veteran bouquet and the chilling but quite human berling ."positive,it's fascinating to see how bettany and mcdowell play off each other .positive,"the film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of joan's madness ."positive,leigh's film is full of memorable performances from top to bottom .positive,one of the most significant moviegoing pleasures of the year .positive,"jose campanella delivers a loosely autobiographical story brushed with sentimentality but brimming with gentle humor , bittersweet pathos , and lyric moments that linger like snapshots of memory ."positive,"generally , clockstoppers will fulfill your wildest fantasies about being a different kind of time traveler , while happily killing 94 minutes ."positive,the movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that's all too rare in hollywood's hastier productions .positive,"ao sair do cinema , eu estava feliz e com saudades de um tempo em que , para mim , a existência de papai noel era um fato inquestion_vel ."positive,"neither parker nor donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula ."positive,"it's a much more emotional journey than what shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and gibson , stepping in for bruce willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip ."positive,"not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and daniel radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as harry , but the film conjures the magic of author j . k . rowling's books ."positive,jaglom . . . put[s] the audience in the privileged position of

or comprehensible narrative . still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed ."positive,"so unassuming and pure of heart , you can't help but warmly extend your arms and yell 'safe ! '"positive,an intriguing cinematic omnibus and round-robin that occasionally is more interesting in concept than in execution .positive,so refreshingly incisive is grant that for the first time he'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the hugh factor .positive,"at a time when half the so-called real movies are little more than live-action cartoons , it's refreshing to see a cartoon that knows what it is , and knows the form's history ."positive,the magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances .positive,"hoffman notches in the nuances of pain , but his smart , edgy voice and waddling profile ( emphasized here ) accent the humor of wilson's plight , and that saves his pathos from drippiness ."positive,what better message than 'love thyself' could young women of any size receive ?positive,the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda .positive,"84 minutes of rolling musical back beat and supercharged cartoon warfare . it's also , clearly , great fun ."positive,. . . takes the beauty of baseball and melds it with a story that could touch anyone regardless of their familiarity with the sportpositive,"seldahl's barbara is a precise and moving portrait of someone whose world is turned upside down , first by passion and then by illness ."positive,"a warm but realistic meditation on friendship , family and affection ."positive,"byler reveals his characters in a way that intrigues and even fascinates us , and he never reduces the situation to simple melodrama ."positive,turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting .positive,bogdanovich tantalizes by offering a peep show into the lives of the era's creme de la celluloid .positive,people cinema at its finest .positive,the performances take the movie to a higher level .positive,"what really makes it special is that it pulls us into its world , gives us a hero whose suffering and triumphs we can share , surrounds him with interesting characters and sends us out of the theater feeling we've shared a great adventure ."positive,". . . a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs _ sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh ."positive,"manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer ."positive,dense with characters and contains some thrilling moments .positive,a true pleasure .positive,lapaglia's ability to convey grief and hope works with weaver's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class .positive,reign of fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way .positive,"altogether , this is successful as a film , while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece ."positive,"we root for [clara and paul] , even like them , though perhaps it's an emotion closer to pity ."positive,the best film about baseball to hit theaters since field of dreams .positive,"instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life ."positive,the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries .positive,"if the count of monte cristo doesn't transform caviezel into a movie star , then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago ."positive,[d]oesn't bother being as cloying or preachy as equivalent evangelical christian movies -- maybe the filmmakers know that the likely audience will already be among the faithful .positive,"as a tolerable diversion , the film suffices ; a triumph , however , it is not ."positive,"if director michael dowse only superficially understands his characters , he doesn't hold them in contempt ."positive,if your taste runs to 'difficult' films you absolutely can't miss it .positive,"[city] reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of 'analyze this' ( 1999 ) and 'analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year ."positive,". . . a story we haven't seen on the big screen before , and it's a story that we as americans , and human beings , should know ."positive,"like leon , it's frustrating and still oddly likable ."positive,"all in all , the count of monte cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based ."positive,"if you can stomach the rough content , it's worth checking out for the performances alone ."positive,"looking aristocratic , luminous yet careworn in jane hamilton's exemplary costumes , rampling gives a performance that could not be improved upon ."positive,"' . . . mafia , rap stars and hood rats butt their ugly heads in a regurgitation of cinematic violence that gives brutal birth to an unlikely , but likable , hero . '"positive,"on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion ."positive,"fun , flip and terribly hip bit of cinematic entertainment ."positive,montias . . . pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters .positive,falls neatly into the category of good stupid fun .positive,the film's performances are thrilling .positive,"even in its most tedious scenes , russian ark is mesmerizing ."positive,"the continued good chemistry between carmen and juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained ."positive,reggio's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking .positive,"unfortunately , it appears that [jackie] chan's us influence is starting to show in his hong kong films ."positive,it all adds up to good fun .positive,"a big , gorgeous , sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand , uncomplicated fashion ."positive,the wanton slipperiness of * corpus and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art .positive,a stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for kissinger as a calculating war criminal .positive,sade is an engaging look at the controversial eponymous and fiercely atheistic hero .positive,"a quiet , pure , elliptical film"positive,"kinnear doesn't aim for our sympathy , but rather delivers a performance of striking skill and depth ."positive,"the subtle strength of "" elling "" is that it never loses touch with the reality of the grim situation ."positive,"a study in shades of gray , offering itself up in subtle plot maneuvers . . ."positive,"the format gets used best . . . to capture the dizzying heights achieved by motocross and bmx riders , whose balletic hotdogging occasionally ends in bone-crushing screwups ."positive,has a lot of the virtues of eastwood at his best .positive,"chilling but uncommercial look into the mind of jeffrey dahmer , serial killer ."positive,"though it's become almost redundant to say so , major kudos go to leigh for actually casting people who look working-class ."positive,it deserves to be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in the events shaping the world beyond their own horizons .positive,a movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it's approached with imagination and flair .positive,a subtle and well-crafted ( for the most part ) chiller .positive,"warm water under a red bridge is a quirky and poignant japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women , water , nature , and sexuality ."positive,"although laced with humor and a few fanciful touches , the film is a refreshingly serious look at young women ."positive,"the best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence ."positive,"a delectable and intriguing thriller filled with surprises , read my lips is an original . this is a story of two misfits who don't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent ."positive,"highbrow self-appointed guardians of culture need not apply , but those who loved cool as ice have at last found a worthy follow-up ."positive,"one of creepiest , scariest movies to come along in a long , long time , easily rivaling blair witch or the others ."positive,"maud and roland's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but labute pulls off a neater trick in possession : he makes language sexy ."positive,"pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical ."positive,rare birds has more than enough charm to make it memorable .positive,manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time .positive,"this nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an eddie murphy film . and just when you think it can't get any more gay , in pops nathan lane ."positive,"no sophomore slump for director sam mendes , who segues from oscar winner to oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand ."positive,"the movie isn't just hilarious : it's witty and inventive , too , and in hindsight , it isn't even all that dumb ."positive,old-form moviemaking at its best .positive,ahhhh . . . revenge is sweet !positive,yakusho and shimizu . . . create engaging characterizations in imamura's lively and enjoyable cultural mix .positive,you will emerge with a clearer view of how the gears of justice grind on and the death report comes to share airtime alongside the farm report .positive,"ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy , old-fashioned entertainment out of it ."positive,"in spite of good housekeeping's unsavory characters and wwf mentality , this white trash war of the roses is a surprisingly engaging film ."positive,collateral damage finally delivers the goods for schwarzenegger fans .positive,there has always been something likable about the marquis de sade .positive,"as a first-time director , paxton has tapped something in himself as an actor that provides frailty with its dark soul ."positive,"for the most part , director anne-sophie birot's first feature is a sensitive , extraordinarily well-acted drama ."positive,"by the time we learn that andrew's turnabout is fair play is every bit as awful as borchardt's coven , we can enjoy it anyway ."positive,this riveting world war ii moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of american culture : racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms .positive,"a tender , heartfelt family drama ."positive,"a difficult , absorbing film that manages to convey more substance despite its repetitions and inconsistencies than do most films than are far more pointed and clear ."positive,"for the most part , it's a work of incendiary genius , steering clear of knee-jerk reactions and quick solutions ."positive,"it has the charm of the original american road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker's motherland ."positive,huppert's superbly controlled display of murderous vulnerability ensures that malice has a very human face .positive,"passable entertainment , but it's the kind of motion picture that won't make much of a splash when it's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards ."positive,i just loved every
